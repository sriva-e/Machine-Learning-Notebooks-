# Machine-Learning-Notebooks
These are my python notebooks , where I solve machine learning problems. 

First notebook: contains Explorartry analysis of NYC airbnb data set , I have used linear regression using 9 features and analysed how that would influence the price and also calculated the RSS function at end .

Second Notebook: contains method of bootstrapping a Confidence Interval and and Downsampling Images of MRI datset 

Third Notebook: contains a model which recognises the gender of a person based on their voice and moreover I have also performed a Regression Analysis on MRI Images Dataset , I have performed Logistic Regression,Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis on the aforementioned image dataset 

Fourth Notebook: In this I have trained a Multi layer perceptron and Deep Neual network using Keras , MLP was trained on MNSIT fasion dataset and Neural network was trained on MRI dataset, I have trained the models and also stated out their accuracies. 

Fifth Noteboom: In this notebook we trained a convolutional neural netwrok using Keras , after that I constructed a CNN using the Pretrained Network to classify the images in the MRI dataset. And the acuuracy of the model was increased after pretraining 

My motto is to learn,code and contribute!
